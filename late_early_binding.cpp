// CPP program to illustrate
// working of Virtual Functions
/*late binding (Runtime) is done in accordance with the content of pointer (i.e. location pointed
//to by pointer) and Early binding (Compile time) is done according to the 
//type of pointer, since print() function is declared with virtual keyword so it will be bound at
//runtime (output is print derived class as pointer is pointing to object of
//derived class) and show() is non-virtual so it will be bound during compile time (output is 
// show base class as pointer is of base type).

conclusion : late bind -> content of pointer ,and early bind -> type of pointer; and virtual is bound at runtime;
